# 🎓 Uni Codebase

This is a dump of all the code I wrote during university — rushed assignments, barely-working lab files, and just enough logic to not fail.

No late nights, no deep passion for algorithms, just vibes, deadlines, and the occasional burst of “oh no, it’s due tomorrow.”

It’s not optimized, elegant, or even well-commented — but it exists, it ran once (probably), and it got me closer to a degree.

Use it if you want, but don't ask questions. I won’t remember writing half of this.
